# Smart Panel Light Transformer

**Overview**

This project showcases an IoT-based solution for remotely controlling panel lights using Flutter and Firebase. With a user-friendly mobile app, users can adjust brightness levels and turn their panel lights on or off. 

**Key Features**

* Intuitive Flutter-based mobile interface for easy light management.
* Firebase Realtime Database enables seamless synchronization between the app and the lighting system. 
* Hardware integration with [specify microcontroller used] to manipulate the panel light's transformer.
* Open-source design facilitates customization and expansion.

**Technologies**

* Flutter 
* Firebase (Realtime Database)
* [Specify microcontroller used] (e.g., Arduino)
* Hardware components: relays, panel light transformer, etc.

**Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

* Flutter development environment set up ([https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
* A Firebase project with Realtime Database enabled ([https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/))
* [Specify microcontroller] board and necessary hardware components.

**Instructions**

1. Clone this repository.
2. **Flutter App Setup:** 
    * Navigate to the `flutter_app` directory.
    * Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
    * Connect your Firebase project to the Flutter app (follow Firebase's Flutter setup guide).
3. **Hardware Setup:**
   * Assemble the hardware components as per the circuit diagram (provide a diagram if possible). 
   * Upload the Arduino code (found in the `hardware` directory) to your microcontroller.
4. Run the Flutter app: `flutter run`

**Project Structure**

* `flutter_app/`: Contains the Flutter application source code.
* `hardware/`: Contains the Arduino (or other microcontroller) code.
* `README.md`: This file.
* `[Optional] circuit_diagram.png`:  A visual diagram of your hardware setup.

**Future Enhancements**

* Implement light scheduling capabilities.
* Add color control for RGB panel lights.
* Integrate with additional smart home devices.
